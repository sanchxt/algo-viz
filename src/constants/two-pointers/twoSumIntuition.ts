      "Instead of checking every possible pair (which would be slow), you can use two pointers - one at the beginning and one at the end.",
      "If the current sum is too small, you need a larger number, so move the left pointer right.",
      "If the current sum is too large, you need a smaller number, so move the right pointer left.",
      "This way, you systematically eliminate possibilities and converge toward the solution.",

If their current position gives a sum that's too small, the person on the left (smaller numbers) steps forward. If the sum is too large, the person on the right (larger numbers) steps back. They keep adjusting their positions until they meet at exactly the right sum, or determine it's impossible when they cross paths.",
